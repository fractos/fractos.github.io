It's time to start moving properly towards DevOps at Digirati.

It's not surprising that there is a disconnect between current development and the production environment because it is far from self-service. I have been acting as a gateway from developer to devops, taking receipt of software in various repositories and converting it for use in containers before adding the resulting container to an operations ecosystem. It doesn't help that I'm a control freak - I might as well have been given crack to play with. A great deal of this process is going to be the relinquishing of control of operation tasks by enabling other developers to perform them themselves. It will be up to product owners to say where the comfort level is for technical responsibility.
